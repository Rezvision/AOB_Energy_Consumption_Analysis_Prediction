# AOB_Energy_Consumption_Analysis_Prediction
Energy Management Analysis Project
Overview

This project is a collaborative effort between Swansea University and Morgan Advanced Studies Institute (MASI) aimed at enhancing energy management practices through the application of machine learning (ML) models. The focus of this project is to explore and evaluate the effectiveness of various simple ML models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Lasso, and Ridge, in predicting and optimizing energy consumption.
Funding

This project is generously funded by Morgan Advanced Studies Institute (MASI), supporting the advancement of energy management solutions.
